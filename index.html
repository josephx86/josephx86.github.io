    <h1>Journey through the OSS Univeristy Computer Science Program</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I have decided to pursue the <a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science" target="_blank">OSS University Computer Science</a> program. I have always wanted to do Computer Science but let's just say life got in the way. At least that is the short answer. Now, I can learn at my own pace and there is a sense of achievement when I complete each course. I am hoping not to take as more than a year but everywhere I read online, it seems everyone thinks the entire "degree program" will take longer.  I guess I only have one thing to say: Challenge acccepted. Yes, that is the student spirit! XD</p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>Going back about a week in time, I registered for the program on Oct 7, 2015. So I guess that was my 'first day of school'. I immediately started the Edx Hardvard CS50 course. </p>

    <h2><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info" target="_blank">HarvardX: CS50x3 Introduction to Computer Science</a></h2>
    <h3><em>Oct 14, 2015</em></h3>
    <p>You can check more details about <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info" target="_blank">CS50 here</a>. So far the course seems to be an introduction to programming?? At least that is how I see it. Week 0 introduced me to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, which is a really cool and nifty programming environment. Coming from languages like C#, C, PHP, Java, and so on, and then using Scratch, I have to say that I now appreciate the power and capabilities of those languages. While Scratch is easy to learn and understand (it literally takes a few minutes to get the hang of it), it is also somewhat crippled when you are coming from programming tools that are not as restrictive. In any case, Scratch makes programming fun and enjoyable. I am just not sure how I can use Scratch in a real-world scenario, but I'm sure with time I will figure it out... I mean, it has only been a week since I knew the language/tool even existed. </p>
    <p>I enjoyed Week 1 more than 0 because the tutorials focused on good old C language. Yes, it was just the basic hello-world bits but all the same, it felt good to be using familiar tools. So far I like the course and I will see how things shape up as time goes.</p>
